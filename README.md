### Summary 

Because prior meta-analyses of randomized trials have suggested that relative treatment effects by sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are larger in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), we investigate the potential heterogeneity of treatment benefits along the continuum of cardiovascular risk. 

We perform a systematic review of cardiovascular outcome, heart failure and renal outcome trials. Subsequently, we conduct meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses of included trial data on SGLT2i and GLP-1RAs effectiveness measures using hazard ratios (HRs), estimated absolute risk differences, and cardiovascular mortality rates in the control group as proxy for baseline risk. In addition, we perform similar analyses to investigate the potential mediating effect of weight loss as well as other cardiometabolic risk factors.

The findings from our meta-analyses inform drug effect estimates for microsimulations of guideline-based and alternative strategies of novel diabetes medication.
