# Sys-Rev-Meta

Because prior meta-analyses of randomized trials have suggested that relative treatment effects by sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are larger in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), we investigate the potential heterogeneity of treatment benefits along the continuum of cardiovascular risk. 

We perform a systematic review of cardiovascular outcome, heart failure and renal outcome trials. Subsequently, we conduct meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses of included trial data on SGLT2i and GLP-1RAs effectiveness measures using hazard ratios (HRs), estimated absolute risk differences, and cardiovascular mortality rates in the control group as proxy for baseline risk. In addition, we perform similar analyses to investigate the potential mediating effect of weight loss as well as other cardiometabolic risk factors.

The findings from our meta-analyses inform drug effect estimates for microsimulations of guideline-based and alternative strategies of novel diabetes medication.

MEPS-Bootstrap-EXPND-SF6D
Here, we develop novel statistical codes to bootstrap weighted AHRQ Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) survey data to incorporate parameter uncertainty around regression equations that predict annual health care expenditures and health-state preference weights based on diabetes, cardiovascular diagnoses, and other individual characteristics. 

MEPS comprises of publicly available, de-identified data from a nationally representative sample of families and individuals subsampled from the prior year’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. Each panel consists of two years with 5 rounds of interviews for each individual. 

We define the first year as “baseline” and second year as the one-year “outcome” period. For estimation of annual expenditures and SF-6D utility scores, we use multivariable regression analyses optimized for distribution and link function accounting for the survey sampling design. 
Medical expenditures and out-of-pocket costs are adjusted to reflect the most recent financial year using the Personal Consumer Expenditures and Consumer Price Index, respectively. Generic preference-weighted quality of life (“utility”) scores are calculated from the individual-level SF-12 questionnaire data using the Short Form (SF)-6D health utility index.
